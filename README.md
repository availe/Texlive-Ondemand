## Introduction

Serving TexLive Files in an On-Demand Manner.

To start the server, run `docker-compose up --build`.

If the `.fmt` files are outdated, open `index.html` (in the public directory) and click the download buttons; the
updated files will be saved to
your computer's download directory. Replace `swiftlatexpdftex.fmt` and `swiftlatexxetex.fmt` with the
newly
downloaded versions.
